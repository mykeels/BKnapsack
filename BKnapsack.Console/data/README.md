### Datasets

Let's talk about datasets. We have Nine (9) multi-knapsack problem classes, each with Thirty (30) problems. In all, we have 270 multi-knapsack problems to solve.

See a sample dataset [here](mknapcb1/mknapcb1-1.json). I recommend [json editor online](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) for expanding the data into a more readable format.

To grasp an understanding of the data or why we are even doing this, please read [this](../Knapsack.md).
